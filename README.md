# Symbols Sense Layer
- a symbols layer that makes sense.

## Key ideas, SSLayer:

- is exceptionally easy to memorize thanks to it symmetrical intuitive design;
- is suitable for programmers, specialists and regular users. Whether you are writing Python code, navigating in the terminal or working in accounting software with special symbols codes - the layout is truly universal! Writing symbols-rich texts also becomes a pleasure;
- is greate for non-English keyboard users, making symbols placement concistent across languages thanks to the Right Alt layer utilization. ALL symbols are accessible from ANY language, no more switching to type one symbol and no more confusion because of the different placements of the same symbols! 
- can be used with both programmable (full: symbols and numbers layers) and regular keyboards (without numbers on the homerow, just SSLayer symbols and numbers in their standard places) thanks to the Right Alt layer utilization.

## Symbols placement justifications:

### General:

- `.`, `,`, `%`, `grave` are in their QWERTY places. `&`, `|` are _almost_ in their QWERTY places; 
- `{`-`}`, `(`-`)`, `[`-`]`, `<`-`>`, `!`-`|`, `?`-`!`, `/`-`\` - are placed symmetrically, making them easier to remember;
- `{}`-`[]`, `"`-`'`, `:`-`;` - are placed one above the other, just as they are accessible with Shift in QWERTY;
- `{} () []` are inward rolls
- `;) :) ;] :] ;} :}` are inward rolls as well :)
- `:`, `%`, `=`, `-`, `+`, `*`, `^`, `$`, `~`, `/`, `.` are not at the homerow, therefore, they do not overlap with numbers, making it possible to type time, dates, percents, money, and use a calculator without having to switch the numbers layer! 


### Tool-specific:

- `<>` are placed where programmable keyboards users usually put their arrows keys 
- `#` at the homerow, making it easier to write commets

#### Linux and Bash
 
- `~/`, `./` - CLI navigation with ease

#### Vim:

- `^`, `$` - start and end of a line 
- `:` next to `w` and `q` makes it possible for newbies to exit 
- `"`, `+` are not at the homerow (therefore, they do not overlap with numbers), making Vim registers nicier
- `+` is at `y` in Colemak, making it nicier to copy from Vim to the OS clipboard

## TODO:

- Add installation instructions and files (both Linux and Windows)
- Add more tool-specific justifications (especially for various programming languages)
